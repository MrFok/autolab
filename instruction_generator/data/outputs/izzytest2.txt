Summary: The goal of this lab is to prepare fixatives for the anterior capsule and limbs, induce a cataract, and set up the work table for the dissection of a pig eye.

Procedure:
- Ensure that the lab space has shelves for storage, a sink for utensil cleaning, a hood, a microwave, and a mini fridge.
- Prepare a fixative for the anterior capsule to reduce elasticity.
- Prepare fixatives to inject into the limbs to induce a cataract.
- Set up the work table with an operating microscope and teaching scope for instruction.
- Lay out all the necessary instruments.
- Use a foam head to secure the pig eye in place, pinning it down with pens at the approximate location of the rectus muscles.
