Summary:
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate the setup and equipment available in the wet lab space for performing eye-related experiments.

Procedure:
- Ensure that the wet lab space has shelves for storage of instruments and supplies, a sink for utensil cleaning, and a few hoods for ventilation.
- Prepare a fixative for the anterior capsule to reduce elasticity, if needed.
- Prepare fixatives for injection into limbs to induce cataracts, if desired.
- Use the microwave to induce a cataract in a large eye, and store it in the mini fridge.
- Set up the work table with an operating microscope and teaching scope for instructional purposes.
- Lay out all the necessary instruments on the table.
- Use a foam head to secure the pig eye, pinning it down with pens at the approximate location of the rectus muscles.
