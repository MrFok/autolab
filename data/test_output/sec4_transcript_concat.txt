another thing I want to mention about cleaning is that if you do use any surgical lube and a cannulas if you leave these [0.0-7.0]
 overnight the canyon as well Gunk up with the surgical Lube so it's always a good idea to take these off rinse them out or soak them in water to keep them clean otherwise you'll have to have new ones and if you have a tip for the syringe you can actually just cap that and then you have it ready to use for next time [7.0-24.0]
 and then of course [24.0-26.0]
